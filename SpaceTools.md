# Space Tools

This repository is a compilation of space / astronomy related tools, libraries and software. Libraries and packages have a dedicated focus on Python. Further, all tools that are listed here shall have an Open Source license (or be at least Freeware; but anything that is not Open Source will be flagged accordingly...).

If applicable, a YouTube link to [my channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Astroniz) is provided that gives a quick introduction or tutorial on the corresponding software or library.

## Python libraries

| Library                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | YouTube Link |

| [Skyfield](https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/) | A high-level API to compute the positions of celestial objects like stars, planets or satellites. Skyfield has the functionality to load and interpret SPICE kernels and can be used to calculate geo-location-depending events like Solar or Lunar eclipses as well as planet rises or moon phases. Different coordinate systems and osculating elements can be considered to get a detailed understanding of asteroids and comets, too. | TBD          |
