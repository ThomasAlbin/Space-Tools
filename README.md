# Space Tools

This repository is a compilation of space / astronomy related tools, libraries and software. Libraries and packages have a dedicated focus on Python. Further, all tools that are listed here shall have an Open Source license (or be at least Freeware; but anything that is not Open Source will be flagged accordingly...).

If applicable, a YouTube link to [my channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Astroniz) is provided that gives a quick introduction or tutorial on the corresponding software or library.

## Python libraries

| [astropy](https://www.astropy.org)                   | *THE* Python package with a large set of astronomy-related tools. *astropy* is widely used in the professional astronomy and astrophysics community for miscellaneous scientific and engineering tasks and use cases. Several data source can be accessed; cosmology as well as astro-statistics sub-modules are integrated; and astronomy-specialized visualization functions are also part of this package.<br/>Additionally, so called [*affiliated packages*](https://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html)Â are listed that are partly listed and described here, too. | TBD          |
| [jdcal](https://github.com/phn/jdcal)                | Basic package that contains conversion functionalities between Gregorian and Julian calendar format as well as (Modified) Julian Date (JD).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | TBD          |
| [poliastro](https://docs.poliastro.space/en/stable/) | Astrodynamics in our Solar System can easily be done with this library. Whether one wants to plot and analyze Near-Earth Objects or the trajectory of the Tesla Roadster in space, or more sophisticated computations like the Tisserand-Parameter change during a fly-by: *poliastro* has analytical and numerical capabilities for astro-dynamical questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | TBD          |
| [Skyfield](https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/)         | A high-level API to compute the positions of celestial objects like stars, planets or satellites. Skyfield has the functionality to load and interpret SPICE kernels and can be used to calculate geo-location-depending events like Solar or Lunar eclipses as well as planet rises or moon phases. Different coordinate systems and osculating elements can be considered to get a detailed understanding of asteroids and comets, too.                                                                                                                                   | TBD          |
