# Space Tools

This repository is a compilation of space / astronomy related tools, libraries and software. Libraries and packages have a dedicated focus on Python. Further, all tools that are listed here shall have an Open Source license (or be at least Freeware; but anything that is not Open Source will be flagged accordingly...).

If applicable, a YouTube link to [my channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Astroniz) is provided that gives a quick introduction or tutorial on the corresponding software or library.

| [healpy](https://github.com/healpy/healpy)                         | How can one "divide" the sky or a map? Especially, if one wants to compute and visualize e.g. densities of objects? There are several ways, like considering the haversine metric. NASA introduced a package called [HEALPix](https://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/), short for: Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization (of a sphere). The idea: Dividing a sphere in "pixels" that cover the same surface area. healpy is the Python implementation of this package.                                                                                                     | TBD                                            |
| [Lightkurve](https://docs.lightkurve.org/)                         | "Time domain astronomy / astrophysics" is covered with this library. *Lightkurve* provides functions, tools and small tutorials on how to analyse light-curves of stars, galaxies and / or planets. One can work on any light-curve even, however this package provides and easy-access API to NASA’s Kepler and TESS space telescope data. If you want to know how to determine the transit of an exoplanet in front of its host-start, *Lightkurve* is the way to go.                                                                                                     | TBD                                            |
| [poliastro](https://docs.poliastro.space/en/stable/)               | Astrodynamics in our Solar System can easily be done with this library. Whether one wants to plot and analyze Near-Earth Objects or the trajectory of the Tesla Roadster in space, or more sophisticated computations like the Tisserand-Parameter change during a fly-by: *poliastro* has analytical and numerical capabilities for astro-dynamical questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [Link](https://youtube.com/shorts/ZtW9QeLXfE8) |
| [Skyfield](https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/)                       | A high-level API to compute the positions of celestial objects like stars, planets or satellites. Skyfield has the functionality to load and interpret SPICE kernels and can be used to calculate geo-location-depending events like Solar or Lunar eclipses as well as planet rises or moon phases. Different coordinate systems and osculating elements can be considered to get a detailed understanding of asteroids and comets, too.                                                                                                                                   | TBD                                            |
| [specutils](https://specutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) | *specutils* is an astropy associated package that provides API to analyze spectral data. It is an expert tool for scientists to fit spectral lines, conduct data reduction and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | TBD                                            |

| [Global CTX Mosaic of Mars](https://murray-lab.caltech.edu/CTX/) | This tool is a "Mars Globe" application with a high-resolution of around 5 meters / pixel. The tool allows one to "visit" iconic places like Olympus Mons or Valles Marineris, as well as the locations where the rovers landed (+ their corresponding paths). Additionally, the site provides information on how to download and handle all data for free. | [Link](https://youtube.com/shorts/4BOh2iOjujk?feature=share) |
